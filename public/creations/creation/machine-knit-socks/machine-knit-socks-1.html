        <p>
            These are socks I knitted on my Singer Mod 700 knitting machine. It's adapted from <a href="https://www.knititnow.com/store/product/710/the-ultimate-machine-knit-socks-ebook/digitialdownload">this pattern</a>. 
            Although it's a bit expensive, and I'm not sure if $30 is worth it for this style of pattern book, but I paid it so ig it is lol.
            This photo shows the socks as they've just come from the sink from soaking. They're a bit wet and wrinkly at the moment, but I was super excited 
            to share them, haha. I'll update the photos in the future. 

            I've definitely learned a LOT from this project, and I can't wait to make more socks!

            <li>Pattern: <a href="https://www.knititnow.com/store/product/710/the-ultimate-machine-knit-socks-ebook/digitialdownload">The ULTIMATE Machine Knit Socks (eBook)</a></li>
            <li>Yarn: <a href="https://yarn-store.com/yarn/by-brand/hikoo/cobasi/#">CoBaSi 57 & 69</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, there's some good and bad things about the pattern I used. </p>

        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly Knit Up</li>
            <li>Don't need to fiddle the with ribber too much</li>
            <li>very versatile pattern- I made an excel sheet I can input measurements in and it's super customizable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SEAMING</li>
            <ul><li>I absolutely HATE seaming my knit items. It keeps me from completing projects that are basically finished. These socks require
                minimal seaming as the sew-as-you-go method closes the sole of the foot while knitting the top of the foot. However, even the small amount
                I had to seam here took forever, haha. 
            </li></ul>
