                      <p>hello! I am jacksn. this site is a still a bit of a work in progress as you may see.<p>
                      <p>I read about decentralizing the internet and social media and blahblahblah and figured it'd be fun to make a 
                      site and build community :D</p>
                      <h4>interests:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>knitting! (and crochet occasionally)</li>
                        <li>currently a proud owner of an singer mod 700 knitting machine</li>
                        <li>catsss. i have two cuties...pictures to be added in the future</li>
                        <li>space and junk :D. (on the astrology aspect i'm a taurus hehe)</li>
                        <li>also the combo of cats + space to make some fun art. which can be seen throughout the site on occasion</li>
                        <li>languages. I love learning languages. I've studied quite a few but can really only say i'm fluent in Korean and English.</li>
                        <li>more things i can't think of ! </li>

                        <p>Hello hello. It has been quite a bit since I've updated anything. I've got a big update coming in the future!
                        For now, however, I've just added my newly knitted sweater :V </p>
                        <p>This piece is my pride and joy and I cannot wait until it gets cold until I can start wearing it</p>
                        <p>I'm going to be picking up a knitting machine I purchased a while ago, soon! Super duper uper excited for that.
                            I'll be showing y'all what I end up making with it as I create the items. Additionally, I just started dyeing yarn...which has been..unsucessful to say the least.
                            I've unded up tangling both skiens I've worked with...which i need to figure out bc it's extremely wasteful :(
                        </p>

                      <h1>Update 4</h1>
                      <p>I'm starting to realize I should have all these updates be a thing on the side of the screen haha. or at least get a scrollbar..
                      </p>
                      <p>also my computer screen just died out of nowhere so i'm editing this on another device which is kinda annoying bc i can't use 
                      the ide i was using...oh well. I'm grateful I will be able to get it fixed soon</p>
                      <p>anyhoo, i added a lil bio at the top of the screen here above all the updates. and these updates are mainly for me to see
                      my progress throughout the site and have some sort of documentation haha. </p>

                        <p>I've got the baseline done for the creations and blog areas, so the final thing is having 
                            the landing page for the consumptionconsortium. Once that's done, the framework for the site will
                            be just about finished! There are a few more things I'd like to add as well, like 
                            <ul>
                                <li>sitemap</li>
                                <li>join a webring? i'm trying to find a nice crafting one hopefully :D</li>
                                <li>add a to-do list</li>
                                <li>start getting the art all together...homestead?</li>

                            Anyhoo we will see! I've also got to be careful I don't burn myself out spending so much time
                            coding and junk.

                            <li><p>I've started using Visual Studio to code instead of the Neocities built-in system, and it is <em>AMAZING</em>.
                                I definitely reccomend it.     
                            </p>

                        <p>Hello! I've recently updated the site a bit. Quite a leap from the last iteration. I've learned quite a bit so far!
                        This process has been so fun and a great new creative outlet...not that I need another, haha. <br>
                        <br>Anyhoo, some of the updates so far are: 
                            <ul id="newchangeslist">
                                <li>

                                    On the right side of the screen (desktop) there's a few links to the newest pages I've made so far.
                                    I've got a <a href="/public/blog/bloghome.html">blog</a>, <a href="/public/creations/creationshome.html">crafts</a>,
                                    and <a href="public/blog/review-spot/consumptionconsortiumhome.html">media review</a> pages made :D.
                                    If you're interested, check those out. There's bound to be some with stuff on those 
                                    pages overlap, but I'm thinking of doing some overlap sort of things with iFrames.
                                    in the future...

                                    of various things that is basically <q>things i like :D</q>. I've got one original button:

                                    and plan to make more probs too.<br>
                                    However, I'm looking for an American Indian button if anyone stumbles across this and happens to have one plz lmk haha.
