    <p>Went out with some friends last night. It was super duper fun aside from the fact that my <q>looking like I eat ham</q>
    likeness was upgraded to looking like I eat bologna. I don't think I've ever consumed bologna.</p>
    <p>This individual was told they look like they eat Corndogs and that upset them quite a bit. I don't understand that 
    one tbh... who doesn't like corndogs? Esp those Morning Star Veggie Corndogs??? All the corn without the dog. So 
    delicious...
