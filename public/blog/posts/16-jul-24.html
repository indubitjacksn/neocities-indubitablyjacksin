        <p>It has been a hot hot second since I've had time to update anything on this site.
         One of the main reasons is because my time has been spent elsewhere.....</p>

        <h3>I've made a few swatches (and some failed projects) so far you can see here</h3>

        <h4>Hand-Dyed Orange Wool Swatches</h4>
        <img src="/blog/resources/orange_hand_wool_swatch1.jpg">
        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.knitpicks.com/yarn/palette-bare/c/5420144">yarn from knitpicks </a> which I dyed with some dye from Dharma Trading Co.
        <img src="/blog/resources/orange_hand_wool_swatch2.jpg">
        <p>This is another swatch I made using a slip stitch pattern for the heel of a sock</p>
        
        <h4>CoBaSi Sock Yarn Samples</h4>
        <p>I also purchased some <a href="https://yarn-store.com/hikoo-cobasi-pumpkin-69/">CoBasSi</a> sock yarn to try on the machine. As you can see below it knit pretty well!</p>
        <p>In the near future I'll be showing my first sucessful project on the machine! (A pair of knit socks!)</p>

        <p>I have a swatch in plain stockinette at different tensions to see what fit best. I liked the bottom section at T7, so that's what 
        I used for my sock in general. Additionally, I made a swatch for the fairisle pattern with a slightly lighter yarn at T6 and had 
        the slip stitch pattern at the bottom at T7 as well.</p>
